# Technical Documentation / LLM Context: `getctx` Tool

## 1. Purpose and Core Functionality

`getctx` (Get Context) is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool written in Go. Its primary purpose is to allow a user to **interactively select files and folders** from the filesystem and then **concatenate the contents** of all selected (and eligible) text files into a single, large output file (defaults to `context.txt`).

The main use case is to quickly aggregate source code context from a project, which can then be pasted into AI tools (LLMs), bug reports, or documentation.

## 2. Project Architecture

The project is structured according to standard Go application layout, with a clear **Separation of Concerns**:

- **`cmd/getctx/main.go`**: **Entrypoint**. It is responsible for:

  - Parsing command-line flags (e.g., `-o` for the output file).
  - Initializing and running the TUI.
  - Passing the results from the TUI to the context-building logic.
  - Handling top-level errors.

- **`internal/app/model.go`**: **Terminal User Interface (TUI) Core**.

  - All interactive logic resides here.
  - Built using the **`bubbletea`** library and the **Model-View-Update** architectural pattern.
  - **Model (`Model` struct):** Holds the entire state of the interface: the current path, the list of files/folders (including their excluded status), the cursor position, and a map of selected items.
  - **View (`View()` method):** Renders the model's state to the terminal screen, using styles from the `lipgloss` library.
  - **Update (`Update()` method):** Handles all user input (key presses) and modifies the model's state accordingly.

- **`internal/app/context_builder.go`**: **Business Logic**.

  - Contains the "brain" of the application that runs after the TUI exits.
  - Responsible for processing the list of selected paths, filtering out non-text files, and building the final `context.txt` file.
  - Prints a summary log to the console about which files are being added and how many were skipped.

- **`internal/app/fs_utils.go`**: **File System Utilities**.

  - A collection of general-purpose helper functions for file and folder operations.
  - **`discoverFiles`**: Recursively scans the given paths, respecting the exclusion list, and returns a list of all found, non-excluded file paths.
  - **`isTextFile`**: Detects if a given file is a text file using a MIME type-based heuristic.

- **`internal/app/theme.go`**: **Theme & Style Definitions**.

  - A central place for managing the application's look and feel.
  - Defines icons (emoji), colors, and complex styles (`lipgloss.Style`) used in both the TUI and the logs.
  - Styles are organized into nested structs for better readability and scalability.

- **`internal/app/keybindings.go`**: **Keybinding Definitions**.

  - A central place that defines all keyboard shortcuts used in the application as constants (`const`). Eliminates "magic strings" in the TUI logic.

- **`internal/app/config.go`**: **Application Configuration**.
  - Stores application-wide configuration, such as the **exclusion list** (`ExcludedNames`) of files and folders to be ignored.

## 3. Key Features and Logic

- **Navigation:** The user navigates the filesystem using the up/down arrow keys. `Enter` opens a directory, and `Backspace` goes to the parent directory.
- **Intelligent File Exclusion (Blacklist):** The tool maintains a configurable list of file and folder names (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, `bin`) to ignore.
  - **Visual Feedback:** Ignored items are displayed in a dimmed, greyed-out style in the TUI and are marked with a `ðŸš«` icon.
  - **Interaction Disabled:** The user cannot select or enter excluded directories or files.
  - **Performance:** Excluded directories are skipped entirely during recursive scans for maximum efficiency.
- **Selection:**
  - `Spacebar`: Toggles the selection for an individual (non-excluded) file or folder under the cursor.
  - `CTRL+A`: Toggles the selection for all non-excluded items in the current view.
- **Non-Text File Filtering:** As a final safety measure, the tool inspects the content of all selected files and includes only those identified as text-based. The user is informed with a summary of how many files were skipped for this reason.
- **Program Exit:**
  - `q`: Exits the interface and **initiates the build process** for the `context.txt` file from the selected items.
  - `CTRL+C`: **Cancels the operation**. Exits the program without saving the file.
- **Styling:** The application makes extensive use of the `lipgloss` library for styling (colors, bolding) in both the interactive TUI and the final log output, ensuring a consistent and modern look.
